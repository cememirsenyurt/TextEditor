# TextEditor

# Terminal Based Text Editor
This powerful terminal-based text editor, crafted as part of the ICS45C course under the guidance of Professor Thornton at the University of California, Irvine. This project leverages the core concepts of C++ programming, including abstract classes, inheritance, and the Command pattern, to create an efficient text editing environment within the command line interface.

# Introduction
In the modern era of graphical user interfaces, the command line remains a potent tool for many professionals. The transition to text-based command-line tools can be challenging, yet rewarding, offering unparalleled efficiency and flexibility. This text editor embodies this philosophy, providing a streamlined text editing experience that harks back to the simplicity and power of traditional command-line editors.

# Features

Cursor Navigation: Intuitive keyboard controls for cursor movement, enabling easy navigation through text.
Text Manipulation: Supports basic text insertion and deletion, facilitating straightforward text editing tasks.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Every action within the editor is reversible with a simple keypress, allowing for easy correction of mistakes.
Memory Management: Utilizes classes from the C++ Standard Library, such as std::vector, to manage memory efficiently and safely.
Exception Handling: Implements robust exception handling to ensure stability and reliability during unexpected scenarios.
Object-Oriented Design: Employs abstract base classes and inheritance to create a flexible and extensible architecture.
Command Pattern: Incorporates the Command pattern to elegantly handle sequences of user actions, enabling undo and redo capabilities.
